In this project, the "crossroads" project is implemented: cars drive, and if a train is moving, they stop. Stopping of cars before train moving is also implemented.
All cars are painted as rectangle with backgound image. Also painting is realised in separate threads, to which i pass the MainWindow. Also generating 
cars is implemented in separate threads.
